/moodledata/repository/swf/content/video/README.txt

Videos in "namespace" subdirectories of this directory,

    e.g. /moodledata/repository/swf/content/video/matbury/myvideo.mp4 

where "matbury" is the namespace, will be automatically listed on the SWF 
Activity Module create/edit instance form in  the "Video, Flash Content, and 
Playlists" section.

Please upload all your videos to your own namespace directory to make it easier for 
you and others to find,

    e.g. /moodledata/repository/swf/content/video/[yournamespace]/ 

where you replace "[yournamespace]" with your own namespace, e.g. "janesmith".
In some cases, a department/faculty/course may have a shared namespace directory 
for all their videos, e.g. /sct_101/. You can organise this however you like.

*IMPORTANT*
Serving large files, e.g. video, from the /moodledata/ directories uses up large
amounts of server memory. Serving large files from medium to large sized Moodle 
installations can lead to disruptions in service during busy periods because the 
server memory limits have been reached and/or the server CPU is overloaded. 
Please consider using other sources of video/video hosting services if this is 
the case.
