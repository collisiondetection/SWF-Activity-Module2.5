MILAs learning content cartridge licence agreement

These terms and conditions are to ensure that legitimate course content developers, teachers and learners can enjoy them to the full while protecting Matt Bury's hard work from piracy, copyright theft, etc. Matt has developed these MILAs in the hope that they will enhance the efficacy, engagement and overall learning experience of everyone who uses them on your website. If you put MILAs in publicly accessible directories, they will be vulnerable to copyright theft and piracy. MILA licences are very reasonably priced and Matt would like to receive some reasonable compensation for the work he has put in.

Summary of the terms and conditions for the use of MILAs learning content cartridge licences
By using this MILA learning content cartridge you agree to the following terms and conditions:

	* MILA learning content cartridge licences are valid for 30 years with no recurring fees and no hidden extras.

    * MILA learning content cartridge licences do not include premium support. Premium support can be purchased as an extra service. In most cases, this is not necessary and support is best handled on the free support forums for all users' benefit.
    * Licensed MILA learning content cartridges must not be accessible on the licensed domain without user login authentication. i.e. Users must be required to login to view MILAs. In the case of Moodle, this means in the course files directories (moodledata) outside the server's public directory.

VERY IMPORTANT!: Important note about MILAs (Flash applications)
Please verify that MILAs function correctly on your Moodle installation before purchasing licences. Server environments can vary greatly and, although Matt Bury has done his best to ensure stability and reliability in as many cases as possible, he cannot guarantee that MILAs will function correctly on every server environment. To verify whether MILAs can function correctly on your server and that they are compatible with your users' web browsers, try the free MILAs (Word search and Concept map) first, which do not require you to purchase a licence. If you have any problems, please contact Matt Bury and, in some cases, he may be able to resolve the issue.

For localhost testing on Windows, Matt Bury recommends installing a standard Moodle 1.9.x package on WampServer. Please note that some MILAs functions do not function correctly on the Moodle Windows installer package from http://download.moodle.org/windows/.
